                    <p>Looking a little like the famous Arc de Triomphe in Paris, the equally impressive India Gate is a
                        magnificent stone arch built as a memorial to Indian soldiers killed in WWI. An eternal flame
                        burns beneath the massive structure, and its walls are inscribed with the names of more than
                        90,000 soldiers who died in the conflict.</p>

                        featuring the history of Qutub along with inscriptions from the Koran. It's also notable for

                        red sandstone, while the fourth and fifth stories were built with marble and sandstone).</p>

                    <h3>About:</h3>
                    <p>The beautiful Red Fort was built by Shah Jahan in 1648 and served as the seat of Mughal power
                        until 1857. This stunning structure, with its tall, red sandstone walls covers an area of more
                        than two square kilometers, the entirety of which is crescent shaped and surrounded by a moat.
                        The impressive main entrance, the Lahore Gate, is so named as it faces towards Lahore in
                        Pakistan, while the even grander Delhi Gate was used by the emperor for ceremonial processions.

                    <p>The magnificent Bahá'í House of Worship, also known as the Lotus Temple due to its nine sides and
                        stunning central dome, is an architectural masterpiece. Constructed of white concrete and
                        marble, the entire structure looks as delicate as the flower it resembles. Rising from the
                        surrounding nine pools of water, it almost appears as if it might burst into bloom at any
                        moment. Built in 1986, the temple has since attracted more than 70 million visitors, making it
                        one of the world's most visited attractions (interestingly, this remarkable place of worship has
                        no idols, religious pictures, or outward symbols of religion).</p>

                    <h3>About:</h3>
                    <p>The Jama Masjid is one of India's largest mosques and was the final architectural feat of Shah
                        Jahan. Completed in 1658, this beautiful structure features three gateways, four angled towers,
                        and two 40-meter-high minarets built using red sandstone and white marble and attractively
                        alternated in vertical stripes. Visitors can climb to the top of the southern minaret for
                        spectacular views of Old Delhi, and afterwards visit the large central pool used for washing
                        before prayers (visitors must take off their shoes and be appropriately dressed before entering;
                        non-Muslims aren't permitted during prayers).</p>

                    <h3>About:</h3>
                    <p>Set in a lovely, large square garden, Humayun's Tomb is a lofty mausoleum constructed of white
                        marble and red sandstone. It was designed as a prototype of the Taj Mahal in Agra and is an
                        excellent example of Mughal architecture. Built in the mid-16th century by Haji Begum as a
                        memorial to her husband by Humayun's senior widow, the tomb is surrounded by lush formal gardens
                        and other tombs including Humayun's barber and the Tomb of Isa Khan (the architect of the Taj
                        Mahal), a fine example of Lodi architecture and octagonal in shape. A fun thing to do is to try
                        and catch a glimpse of this spectacular structure after nightfall when it's illuminated.</p>
